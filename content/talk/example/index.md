abstract: Industry Event day is one of the highlights of the Data Science programme
  at **The University of Sheffield Information School**. As an Alumin of the programme,
  I appreciate the value for students to get to know the industry perspective on 
  Data Science. I had the privilege to be invited alongside many others data 
  scientists to share my working experiences with students.
